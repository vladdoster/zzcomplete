# ZZ Complete [![Gitter][gitter-image]][gitter-link]

Complete options from manual pages â€“ press Ctrl-F to start the completer.

## Motivation

The completion of options has drawbacks:

1. The user has to remember a part of the option he wants to complete.
1. OR forced to read through all the options (listed after TAB).

With ZZ Complete, the user can:

1. Search in the manual for arbitrary text related to the option.
1. Then select the option located nearby the found text.
1. The user can also read about the possible values of the options and select them.

## Asciicast

You can resize the video like a standard web page, i.e., with `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `plus` and `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `minus`.
